**iTunes Search**

> **API:**  
https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html#searching

* Create a tab bar with 3 items: music, movies, apps
* In each view controller, drag a `UITextField` and a `UITableView`
* When the user tapps the "return" key on the keyboard, you should dismiss the keyboard and hit the iTunes API
* Each view controller is responsible for polling the iTunes API for it's repective media type
* After the API returns results, you should reload the table view with some relevant information

> **Bonus:**
* How can you build this so it reuses the same viewcontroller class?
