### Core Data
https://www.objc.io/issues/4-core-data/core-data-overview/

Core Data helps you build the model layer that represents the state of your app. Core Data is also a persistent technology, in that it can persist the state of the model objects to disk.

One of the very powerful things that Core Data provides is its object graph management. This is one of the pieces of Core Data you need to understand and learn in order to bring the powers of Core Data into play.

There are two main parts to this stack. One part is about object graph management, and this should be the part that you know well, and know how to work with. The second part is about persistence, i.e. saving the state of your model objects and retrieving the state again.

In between the two parts, in the middle of the stack, sits the Persistent Store Coordinator (PSC)... It ties together the object graph management part with the persistence part. When one of the two needs to talk to the other, this is coordinated by the PSC.

The object graph management is where your application’s model layer logic will live. Model layer objects live inside a context. In most setups, there’s one context and all objects live in that context.

The other part of the stack is where persistency happens, i.e. where Core Data reads and writes from / to the file system. In just about all cases, the persistent store coordinator (PSC) has one so-called persistent store attached to it, and this store interacts with a SQLite database in the file system.
