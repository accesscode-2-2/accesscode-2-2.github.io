* Subscribe and respond to NSNotifications
* Post NSNotifications

## NSNotification

`NSNotification` objects encapsulate information so that it can be broadcast to other objects by an 
`NSNotificationCenter` object. An `NSNotification` object (referred to as a notification) contains a 
name, an object, and an optional dictionary. The name is a tag identifying the notification. 
The object is any object that the poster of the notification wants to send to observers of that notification 
(typically, it is the object that posted the notification). The dictionary stores other related objects, if any.

## NSNotificationCenter
An `NSNotificationCenter` object (or simply, notification center) provides a mechanism for broadcasting information within a program. 
An `NSNotificationCenter` object is essentially a notification dispatch table.

**How to access the default `NSNotificationCenter`**
```objective-c
[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter];
```

#### Subscribing to `NSNotification`
```objective-c 
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(methodToCall:) name:"NameOfNotification" object:nil];
```

For example, the system posts a notification when your app becomes active.

```objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(appBecameActive:) name:UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification object:nil];
```

#### Posting an `NSNotification`

```objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:"NameOfNotification" object:nil];
```

> **Exercises:**
> In the `viewDidLoad` method of `ViewController.m`, add `self` as an observer to the notification `UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification`. Add an `NSLog()` to the selector. Run the app and press `command + shift + h` to move the app to the background. Open it back up. Do you see the log?
> in the `viewDidLoad` method of `ViewController.m`, add `self` as an observer of a custom `NSNotification`. Create a button. When you click the button, post the custom notification. 
> Check out some other default notifications. Set a breakpoint when the notification fires. What other information is provided by the notification?
