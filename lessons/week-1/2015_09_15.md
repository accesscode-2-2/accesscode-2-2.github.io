## NSNotification

`NSNotification` objects encapsulate information so that it can be broadcast to other objects by an 
`NSNotificationCenter` object. An `NSNotification` object (referred to as a notification) contains a 
name, an object, and an optional dictionary. The name is a tag identifying the notification. 
The object is any object that the poster of the notification wants to send to observers of that notification 
(typically, it is the object that posted the notification). The dictionary stores other related objects, if any.

## NSNotificationCenter
An `NSNotificationCenter` object (or simply, notification center) provides a mechanism for broadcasting information within a program. 
An `NSNotificationCenter` object is essentially a notification dispatch table.
