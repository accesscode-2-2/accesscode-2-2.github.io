# What is a block?

An Objective-C `class` defines an *object that combines data with related behavior*. Sometimes, it makes sense just to represent a *single task* or *unit of behavior*, rather than a collection of methods.

**Blocks** are a language-level feature added to C, Objective-C and C++, which **allow you to create distinct segments of code that can be passed around to methods or functions as if they were values**. Blocks are Objective-C objects, which means they can be added to collections like NSArray or NSDictionary. They also have the ability to capture values from the enclosing **scope**, making them similar to closures or lambdas in other programming languages.

### Block Syntax
The syntax to define a block literal uses the caret symbol `(^)`, like this:
```objective-c
^{
  NSLog(@"This is a block");
}
```

As with function and method definitions, the braces indicate the start and end of the block. In this example, the block doesn’t return any value, and doesn’t take any arguments.

In the same way that you can use a function pointer to refer to a C function, you can declare a variable to keep track of a block, like this:

```objective-c
void (^simpleBlock)(void);
```

If you’re not used to dealing with C function pointers, the syntax may seem a little unusual. This example declares a variable called simpleBlock to refer to a block that takes no arguments and doesn’t return a value, which means the variable can be assigned the block literal shown above, like this:

```objective-c
simpleBlock = ^{
  NSLog(@"This is a block");
};
```

This is just like any other variable assignment, so the statement must be terminated by a semi-colon after the closing brace. You can also combine the variable declaration and assignment:

```objective-c
void (^simpleBlock)(void) = ^{
  NSLog(@"This is a block");
};
```
