* Articulate the use cases of a block
* Understand how blocks relate to scope

# What is a block?

An Objective-C `class` defines an *object that combines data with related behavior*. Sometimes, it makes sense just to represent a *single task* or *unit of behavior*, rather than a collection of methods.

**Blocks** are a language-level feature added to C, Objective-C and C++, which **allow you to create distinct segments of code that can be passed around to methods or functions as if they were values**. Blocks are Objective-C objects, which means they can be added to collections like NSArray or NSDictionary. They also have the ability to capture values from the enclosing **scope**, making them similar to closures or lambdas in other programming languages.

### Block Syntax
The syntax to define a block literal uses the caret symbol `(^)`, like this:
```objective-c
^{
  NSLog(@"This is a block");
}
```

As with function and method definitions, the braces indicate the start and end of the block. In this example, the block doesn’t return any value, and doesn’t take any arguments.

```objective-c
void (^simpleBlock)(void);
```

In the same way that you can use a function pointer to refer to a C function, you can declare a variable to keep track of a block, like this:
